      <p>CanYou Inc. Terms of Service</p>
      <p>Effective: July 1, 2022</p>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the
        &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) so you&rsquo;ll know the rules that govern our
        relationship with you as a user of our Services. Although we have tried
        our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where
        they may still read like a traditional contract. There&rsquo;s a good
        reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you
        and CanYou Inc. (&ldquo;CanYou&rdquo;). So please read them carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using CanYou, or any of our other products or services that are
        subject to these Terms (which we refer to collectively as the
        &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you
        don&rsquo;t agree with them, then don&rsquo;t use the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms apply if you live in the United States or if your principal
        place of business is in the United States. If you live outside of the
        United States or if your principal place of business is outside of the
        United States, CanYou Group Limited provides you the Services and your
        relationship is governed by the CanYou Group Limited Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        ARBITRATION NOTICE: THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE A LITTLE
        LATER ON. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES MENTIONED IN THAT
        ARBITRATION CLAUSE, YOU AND CANYOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN US WILL
        BE RESOLVED BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND YOU AND CANYOU WAIVE
        ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE
        ARBITRATION. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AS EXPLAINED
        IN THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE.
      </p>
      <p>1. Who Can Use the Services</p>
      <p>
        No one under 13 is allowed to create an account or use the Services. If
        you are under 18, you may only use the Services with the prior consent
        of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or legal
        guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you before you
        start using the Services. We may offer additional Services with
        additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So
        please read all terms carefully. By using the Services, you represent,
        warrant, and agree that:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can form a binding contract with CanYou;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are not a person who is barred from using
        the Services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable
        jurisdiction&mdash;including, for example, that you do not appear on the
        U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals
        or face any other similar prohibition;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are not a convicted sex offender; and</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will comply with these Terms and all
        applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other
        entity, you represent that you are authorized to bind that business or
        entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that
        business or entity (and all references to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;your&rdquo; in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and
        that business or entity). If you are using the Services on behalf of an
        entity of the U.S. Government, you agree to the Amendment to CanYou Inc.
        Terms of Service for U.S. Government Users.
      </p>
      <p>2. Rights We Grant You</p>
      <p>
        As between you and us, CanYou (and its licensors) is the owner of the
        Services, including all proprietary content, information, material,
        software, images, text, graphics (including any&nbsp; avatars that you
        may assemble using visual elements we provide), illustrations, logos,
        patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio,
        video, music, and &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the Services, and all
        related intellectual property rights. CanYou grants you a worldwide,
        royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and
        non-sublicensable license to use the Services. This license is for the
        sole purpose of using and enjoying the Services in a way that these
        Terms and our policies, such as our Community Guidelines and Sounds on
        CanYou Guidelines, allow. You may not use the Services in ways that are
        not authorized by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>3. Rights You Grant Us</p>
      <p>
        Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and
        store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in
        that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use
        that content. How broad that license is depends on which Services you
        use and the Settings you have selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all content you submit to the Services, you grant CanYou and our
        affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable
        license to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt,
        edit, publish, analyze, transmit, and distribute that content. This
        license is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing,
        promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new
        ones. This license includes a right for us to make your content
        available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with
        whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the
        Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone as
        well as content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles,
        CanYou Map, or Lens Studio, &ldquo;Public Content.&rdquo; Because Public
        Content is inherently public, you grant CanYou, our affiliates, other
        users of the Services, and our business partners all of the same rights
        you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as
        an unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual
        right and license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit,
        broadcast, syndicate, reproduce, distribute, synchronize, overlay
        graphics and auditory effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display
        all or any portion of your Public Content (including the separate video,
        image, sound recording, or musical compositions contained therein) in
        any form and in any and all media or distribution methods, now known or
        later developed. When you appear in, create, upload, post, or send
        Public Content (including your ), you also grant CanYou, our affiliates,
        other users of the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted,
        worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, and perpetual right and license to
        use the name, likeness, and voice, of anyone featured in your Public
        Content for commercial and non-commercial purposes. This means, among
        other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation if your
        content, videos, photos, sound recordings, musical compositions, name,
        likeness, or voice are used by us, our affiliates, users of the
        Services, or our business partners. For information about how to tailor
        who can watch your content, please take a look at our Privacy Policy and
        Support Site. All Public Content must be appropriate for people ages
        13+.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we&rsquo;re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen,
        and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to
        provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates
        these Terms. You alone, though, remain responsible for the content you
        create, upload, post, send, or store through the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising
        on the Services, including personalized advertising based on the
        information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you.
        Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or
        suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you,
        and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will
        own all rights in any materials or items we develop based on such
        feedback or suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>4. Additional Terms for Specific Services</p>
      <p>
        Additional terms and conditions listed on the CanYou Terms &amp;
        Policies page or that are otherwise made available to you may apply to
        specific Services. If you use those Services, then those additional
        terms become part of these Terms. If any of the applicable additional
        terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will prevail while
        you are using the Services to which they apply.
      </p>
      <p>5. Privacy</p>
      <p>
        Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is
        handled when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>6. The Content of Others</p>
      <p>
        Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers,
        and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent
        privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or entity
        that submitted it. Although CanYou reserves the right to review or
        remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily
        review all of it. So we cannot&mdash;and do not&mdash;guarantee that
        other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply
        with our Terms or Community Guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>7. Respecting the Services and CanYou&rsquo;s Rights</p>
      <p>
        You must also respect CanYou&rsquo;s rights and adhere to the CanYou
        Brand Guidelines,&nbsp; Brand Guidelines, and any other guidelines,
        support pages, or FAQ&rsquo;s published by CanYou or our affiliates.
        That means, among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable,
        or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use branding, logos, icons, user interface
        elements, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials CanYou
        makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these
        Terms, the CanYou Brand Guidelines,&nbsp; Brand Guidelines or other
        brand guidelines published by CanYou or our affiliates;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violate or infringe CanYou&rsquo;s or our
        affiliates&rsquo; copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property
        rights;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy, modify, archive, download, upload,
        disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast, perform,
        display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the
        Services or the content on the Services, other than temporary files that
        are automatically cached by your web browser for display purposes, as
        otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly
        permitted by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service&rsquo;s
        intended functionality;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create more than one account for yourself,
        create another account if we have already disabled your account, attempt
        to access the Services through unauthorized third-party applications,
        solicit login credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease
        access to your account, a username, CanYous, or a friend link;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverse engineer, duplicate, decompile,
        disassemble, or decode the Services (including any underlying idea or
        algorithm), or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the
        Service;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or
        other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract
        other users&rsquo; information;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use or develop any third-party applications that
        interact with the Services or other users&rsquo; content or information
        without our written consent;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the Services in a way that could interfere
        with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully
        enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or
        impair the functioning of the Services;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upload viruses or other malicious code or
        otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security of the
        Services;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to circumvent any content-filtering
        techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the
        Services that you are not authorized to access;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our
        Services or any system or network;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violate any applicable law or regulation in
        connection with your access to or use of the Services; or
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access or use the Services in any way not
        expressly permitted by these Terms or our Community Guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>8. Respecting Others' Rights</p>
      <p>
        CanYou respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore
        may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in
        a manner that violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s rights of
        publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property
        right. When you submit content to the Service, you agree and represent
        that you own that content, or that you have received all necessary
        permissions, clearances, and authorizations in order to submit it to the
        Service (including, if applicable, the right to make mechanical
        reproductions of the musical works embodied in any sound recordings,
        synchronize any compositions to any content, publicly perform any
        compositions or sound recordings, or any other applicable rights for any
        music not provided by CanYou that you include in your content) and grant
        the rights and licenses contained in these Terms for your content. You
        also agree that you will not use or attempt to use another user&rsquo;s
        account except as permitted by CanYou or its affiliates.
      </p>
      <p>
        CanYou honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright
        Act and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services
        any infringing material that we become aware of. If CanYou becomes aware
        that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable
        steps within our power to terminate the user&rsquo;s account. If you
        believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own
        or control, please report it using the form accessible through this
        tool. Or you may file a notice with our designated agent: CanYou Inc.,
        Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email:
        copyright @ CanYou.com. Don&rsquo;t use this email address for anything
        other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be
        ignored. To report other forms of infringement on the Services, please
        use the tool accessible here. If you file a notice with our Copyright
        Agent, it must comply with the requirements set forth at 17 U.S.C.
        &sect; 512(c)(3). That means the notice must:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain the physical or electronic signature of
        a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the copyrighted work claimed to have
        been infringed;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the material that is claimed to be
        infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
        removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information
        reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide your contact information, including your
        address, telephone number, and an email address;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a personal statement that you have a
        good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained
        of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a statement that the information in the
        notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are
        authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      </p>
      <p>9. Safety</p>
      <p>
        We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we
        can&rsquo;t guarantee it. That&rsquo;s where you come in. By using the
        Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms,
        including our Community Guidelines and any other policies CanYou makes
        available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending
        content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and notify
        third parties&mdash;including law enforcement&mdash;and provide those
        third parties with information relating to your account. This step may
        be necessary to protect the safety of our users, and others, to
        investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations, and to
        detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also care about your physical safety while using our Services. So do
        not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying
        traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while
        driving. And never put yourself or others in harm&rsquo;s way just to
        capture a CanYou.
      </p>
      <p>10. Your Account</p>
      <p>
        To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to
        provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your
        account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your
        account. So it&rsquo;s important that you keep your account secure. One
        way to do that is to select a strong password that you don&rsquo;t use
        for any other account. If you think that someone has gained access to
        your account, please immediately reach out to Support. Any software that
        we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates,
        or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic
        downloads through your device&rsquo;s settings. You agree not to create
        any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account
        from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>11. Memories</p>
      <p>
        Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to
        reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you
        automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain
        enabled for as long as you maintain your CanYou account. But you can
        turn off certain Memories features in Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a
        restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a
        passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock
        option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode,
        you make it less likely that another person who gets a hold of your
        device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of
        Memories. But here&rsquo;s a big warning: IF YOU LOSE OR FORGET YOUR
        MEMORIES PASSCODE, OR IF YOU ENTER THE WRONG ONE TOO MANY TIMES, YOU
        WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ANY CONTENT YOU SAVED IN THE RESTRICTED AREA OF
        MEMORIES. We don&rsquo;t offer any passcode recovery features for this
        restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your
        passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more details on passcodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of
        reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on
        our end to terminate your account. Since we can&rsquo;t promise that
        your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate
        copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories
        will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the
        right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits
        from time to time in our sole discretion. And just as with our other
        Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may
        incur mobile data charges.
      </p>
      <p>12. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using
        our Services, including text-messaging (such as SMS, MMS, or future such
        protocols or technologies) and data charges. If you&rsquo;re unsure what
        those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using
        the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing us with your mobile phone number, you agree to receive SMS
        messages from CanYou related to the Services, including about
        promotions, your account, and your relationship with CanYou. These SMS
        messages may be made to your mobile phone number even if your mobile
        phone number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list, or
        international equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to
        create an account, you must update your account information through
        Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending messages intended
        for you to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>13. Third-Party Services</p>
      <p>
        Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data,
        information, applications, features or materials from third parties
        (&ldquo;Third-Party Materials&rdquo;), or provide links to certain
        third-party websites. If you use any Third-Party Materials made
        available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with
        the third party), each party&rsquo;s terms will govern the respective
        party&rsquo;s relationship with you. Neither CanYou nor our affiliates
        are responsible or liable for a third party&rsquo;s terms or actions
        taken under the third party&rsquo;s terms. ​​Further, by using the
        Services, you acknowledge and agree that CanYou is not responsible for
        examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness,
        availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality,
        decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or
        websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not
        have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any
        third-party services, Third-Party Materials or third-party websites, or
        for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.
        Third-Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as
        a convenience to you.
      </p>
      <p>14. Modifying the Services and Termination</p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones
        all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or
        functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services
        altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time for any reason,
        and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we hope you remain a lifelong CanYou User, you can terminate these
        Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your CanYou account
        (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of
        the Services you are using).
      </p>
      <p>
        We may terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if
        you fail to comply with these Terms, our Community Guidelines or the
        law, for any reason outside of our control, or for any reason, and
        without advanced notice. That means that we may terminate these Terms,
        stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new
        or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. And while
        we&rsquo;ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can&rsquo;t
        guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances. For
        example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and
        we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and CanYou continue
        to be bound by Sections 3, 4 (to the extent any additional terms and
        conditions would, by their terms, survive), and 6 - 23 of the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>15. Indemnity</p>
      <p>
        You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and
        hold harmless CanYou, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders,
        employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all
        complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and
        expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) due to, arising out of, or
        relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services, or
        any products or services provided by a third party in connection with
        the Services, even if recommended, made available, or approved by
        CanYou; (b) your content, including infringement claims related to your
        content; (c) your breach of these Terms or any applicable law or
        regulation; or (d) your negligence or willful misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>16. Disclaimers</p>
      <p>
        We try to keep the Services up and running and free of annoyances. But
        we make no promises that we will succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AS
        AVAILABLE&rdquo; AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW WITHOUT WARRANTIES
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, WHILE WE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A
        GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT: (A) THE
        SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR TIMELY; (B) THE SERVICES
        WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS; OR
        (C) THAT ANY CONTENT, USER CONTENT, OR INFORMATION YOU OBTAIN ON OR
        THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE TIMELY OR ACCURATE.
      </p>
      <p>
        NEITHER WE NOR OUR AFFILIATES TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR ASSUME LIABILITY
        FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU, ANOTHER USER, OR A THIRD PARTY CREATES,
        UPLOADS, POSTS, SENDS, RECEIVES, OR STORES ON OR THROUGH OUR SERVICES.
        YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO CONTENT THAT MIGHT
        BE OFFENSIVE, ILLEGAL, MISLEADING, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, NONE OF
        WHICH WE OR OUR AFFILIATES WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.
      </p>
      <p>17. Limitation of Liability</p>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE AND OUR MANAGING MEMBERS,
        SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS
        WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        PUNITIVE, OR MULTIPLE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES,
        WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE,
        GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM: (A) YOUR ACCESS TO
        OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) THE CONDUCT OR
        CONTENT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES; OR
        (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR CONTENT, EVEN IF WE
        HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL
        OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED
        THE GREATER OF $100 USD OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE 12 MONTHS
        PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE ACTIVITY GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
      </p>
      <p>18. Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</p>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT
        YOU AND CANYOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING
        INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.
      </p>
      <p>
        a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 18 (the
        &ldquo;Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;), You and CanYou agree that all
        claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including
        all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these
        Terms or the use of the Services that cannot be resolved in small claims
        court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis,
        except that you and CanYou are not required to arbitrate any dispute in
        which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use
        of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or
        patents. To be clear: the phrase &ldquo;all claims and disputes&rdquo;
        also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the
        effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the
        arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope,
        applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of the
        Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as
        expressly provided below.
      </p>
      <p>
        b. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its
        procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of
        this dispute-resolution provision, and not state law. Arbitration will
        be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (&ldquo;ADR Services&rdquo;)
        (https://www.adrservices.com/). If ADR Services is not available to
        arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum, and if
        they cannot agree, will ask the court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant
        to 9 U.S.C. &sect; 5. The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all
        aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict
        with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral
        arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less
        than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based
        arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or
        disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right
        to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules. Any
        judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
        court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>
      <p>
        c. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance
        arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone,
        online, written submissions, or any combination of the three; the
        specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
        The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties
        or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        d. Fees. ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are
        available at https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/. If CanYou
        is the party initiating an arbitration against you, CanYou will pay all
        costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee.
        If you are the party initiating an arbitration against CanYou, you will
        be responsible for the first $100 toward the nonrefundable Initial
        Filing Fee, and CanYou will pay the remainder of your Initial Filing fee
        and both parties&rsquo; Administrative Fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        e. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the
        jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any,
        of you and CanYou. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other
        matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will
        have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any
        claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award
        monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
        available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules,
        and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement
        of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which
        the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
        The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual
        basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the
        arbitrator is final and binding upon you and CanYou.
      </p>
      <p>
        f. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CANYOU WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
        STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR
        A JURY. You and CanYou are instead electing to have claims and disputes
        resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more
        limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court
        and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation
        between you and CanYou over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration
        award, YOU AND CANYOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect
        instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.
      </p>
      <p>
        g. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES
        WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR
        LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF
        MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY
        OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
        Agreement or ADR Services&rsquo; Rules, disputes regarding the
        interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this waiver may be
        resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If this waiver of
        class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
        neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and
        disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 18.
      </p>
      <p>
        h. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set forth in this
        Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim
        is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of
        this Arbitration Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        i. Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so,
        neither you nor CanYou can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you
        must notify CanYou in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming
        subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your
        name and address, your CanYou username and the email address you used to
        set up your CanYou account (if you have one), and an unequivocal
        statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You
        must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: CanYou Inc., Attn:
        Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email
        the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ CanYou.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        j. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or
        CanYou may bring an individual action in small claims court.
      </p>
      <p>
        k. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will
        survive the termination of your relationship with CanYou.
      </p>
      <p>19. Exclusive Venue</p>
      <p>
        To the extent that these Terms allow you or CanYou to initiate
        litigation in a court, both you and CanYou agree that all claims and
        disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including statutory
        claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use
        of the Services will be litigated exclusively in the United States
        District Court for the Central District of California. If, however, that
        court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all
        such claims and disputes will be litigated exclusively in the Superior
        Court of California, County of Los Angeles. You and CanYou consent to
        the personal jurisdiction of both courts.
      </p>
      <p>20. Choice of Law</p>
      <p>
        Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of
        California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these
        Terms and any claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise)
        arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>21. Severability</p>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that
        provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
      </p>
      <p>22. California Residents</p>
      <p>
        If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code
        &sect; 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance
        Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department
        of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market
        Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800)
        952-5210.
      </p>
      <p>23. Final Terms</p>
      <p>
        These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 4,
        make up the entire agreement between you and CanYou, and supersede any
        prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any third-party
        beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it
        will not be considered a waiver. We reserve the right to transfer our
        rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another entity,
        provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of
        your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We
        reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

      </p>
      <p>CanYou Group Limited Terms of Service</p>
      <p>Effective: September 30, 2021</p>
      <p>Welcome!</p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve drafted these Terms of Service (which we call the
        &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) so you&rsquo;ll know the rules that govern our
        relationship with you as a user of our Services. Although we have tried
        our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where
        they may still read like a traditional contract. There&rsquo;s a good
        reason for that: these Terms form a legally binding contract between you
        and CanYou Group Limited (&ldquo;CanYou&rdquo;). So please read them
        carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to use CanYou, , or any of our other products or services that
        are subject to these Terms (which we refer to collectively as the
        &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you must accept these Terms, which are
        presented to you (i) when you first open the app and (ii) when we make
        any material changes to these Terms. Of course, if you don&rsquo;t
        accept them, then don&rsquo;t use the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms apply if you live outside the United States or if your
        principal place of business is outside of the United States. If you live
        in the United States or if your principal place of business is in the
        United States, CanYou Inc. provides you the Services and your
        relationship is governed by the CanYou Inc. Terms of Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU&rsquo;RE USING THE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF A
        BUSINESS, THEN YOUR BUSINESS WILL BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE
        THAT APPEARS LATER IN THESE TERMS.
      </p>
      <p>1. Who Can Use the Services</p>
      <p>
        No one under 13 (or, if greater than 13, the minimum age at which a
        person may use the Services in your country) is allowed to create an
        account or use the Services. If you are under 18 (or the legal age of
        majority in your country), you may only use the Services with the prior
        consent of your parent or legal guardian. Please be sure your parent or
        legal guardian has reviewed and discussed these Terms with you before
        you start using the Services. We may offer additional Services with
        additional terms that may require you to be even older to use them. So
        please read all terms carefully. By using the Services, you represent,
        warrant, and state that:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can form a binding contract with CanYou;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are not a person who is barred from using
        the Services under the laws of the United States, the United Kingdom, or
        any other applicable jurisdiction&mdash;including, for example, that you
        do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially
        Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are not a convicted sex offender; and</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will comply with these Terms and all
        applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using the Services on behalf of a business or some other
        entity, you state that you are authorised to bind that business or
        entity to these Terms and you agree to these Terms on behalf of that
        business or entity (and all references to &ldquo;you&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;your&rdquo; in these Terms will mean both you as the end user and
        that business or entity).
      </p>
      <p>2. Rights We Grant You</p>
      <p>
        As between you and us, CanYou (and its licensors) is the owner of the
        Services, including all proprietary content, information, material,
        software, images, text, graphics (including any&nbsp; avatars that you
        may assemble using visual elements we provide), illustrations, logos,
        patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio,
        video, music, and &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the Services, and all
        related intellectual property rights. CanYou grants you a worldwide,
        royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and
        non-sublicensable licence to use the Services. This licence is for the
        sole purpose of using and enjoying the Services in a way that these
        Terms and our policies, such as our Community Guidelines and Sounds on
        CanYou Guidelines, allow. You may not use the Services in ways that are
        not authorised by these Terms. Nor may you help anyone else in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>3. Rights You Grant Us</p>
      <p>
        Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and
        store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in
        that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a licence to use
        that content. How broad that licence is depends on which Services you
        use and the Settings you have selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all content you submit to the Services, you grant CanYou and our
        affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicencable, and transferable
        licence to host, store, cache, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt,
        edit, publish, analyse, transmit, and distribute that content. This
        licence is for the purpose of operating, developing, providing,
        promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new
        ones. This licence includes a right for us to make your content
        available to, and pass these rights along to, service providers with
        whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the
        Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone as
        well as content you submit to public Services, like Public Profiles,
        CanYou Map, or Lens Studio, &ldquo;Public Content.&rdquo; Because Public
        Content is inherently public, you grant CanYou, our affiliates, other
        users of the Services, and our business partners all of the same rights
        you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as a
        worldwide, royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to create
        derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate,
        reproduce, distribute, synchronise, overlay graphics and auditory
        effects on, publicly perform, and publicly display all or any portion of
        your Public Content (including the separate video, image, sound
        recording, or musical compositions contained therein) in any form and in
        any and all media or distribution methods, now known or later developed.
        When you appear in, create, upload, post, or send Public Content
        (including your ), you also grant CanYou, our affiliates, other users of
        the Services, and our business partners an unrestricted, worldwide,
        royalty-free, and irrevocable right and licence to use the name,
        likeness, and voice, of anyone featured in your Public Content. This
        means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any
        compensation if your content, videos, photos, sound recordings, musical
        compositions, name, likeness, or voice are used by us, our affiliates,
        users of the Services, or our business partners. The licences granted by
        you for Public Content continue for so long as the Public Content is on
        the Services and for a reasonable period of time after you remove or
        delete the Public Content from the Services (provided we may retain
        server copies of your Public Content indefinitely). For information
        about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at
        our Privacy Policy and Support Site. All Public Content must be
        appropriate for people ages 13+.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent permissible by law, you irrevocably waive&mdash;or agree
        not to assert against CanYou or its affiliates&mdash;any moral rights or
        equivalent rights you may have in content you share on the Services
        throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we&rsquo;re not required to do so, we reserve the right to access,
        review, screen, and delete any content (i) which we think violates these
        Terms, including any additional terms referenced in Section 4, or our
        policies, such as our Community Guidelines, or (ii) if necessary to
        comply with our legal obligations. You alone, though, remain responsible
        for the content you create, upload, post, send, or store through the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, CanYou Inc., our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place
        advertising on the Services, including personalised
        advertising&mdash;with your consent, where required&mdash;based on the
        information you provide us, we collect, or we obtain about you.
        Advertising may sometimes appear near, between, over, or in your
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or
        suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you,
        and without any restriction or obligation to you. You agree that we will
        own all rights in any materials or items we develop based on such
        feedback or suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>4. Additional Terms for Specific Services</p>
      <p>
        Additional terms and conditions listed on the CanYou Terms &amp;
        Policies page or that are otherwise made available to you may apply to
        specific Services. If you use those Services, then those additional
        terms become part of these Terms. If any of the applicable additional
        terms conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will prevail while
        you are using the Services to which they apply.
      </p>
      <p>5. Privacy</p>
      <p>
        Your privacy matters to us. You can learn how your information is
        handled when you use our Services by reading our Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>6. The Content of Others</p>
      <p>
        Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers,
        and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent
        privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the user or entity
        that submitted it. Although CanYou reserves the right to review or
        remove all content that appears on the Services, we do not necessarily
        review all of it. So we cannot&mdash;and do not&mdash;guarantee that
        other users or the content they provide through the Services will comply
        with our Terms or Community Guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>7. Respecting the Services and CanYou&rsquo;s Rights</p>
      <p>
        You must also respect CanYou&rsquo;s rights and adhere to the CanYou
        Brand Guidelines,&nbsp; Brand Guidelines, and any other guidelines,
        support pages, or FAQ&rsquo;s published by CanYou or our affiliates.
        That means, among other things, you may not do, attempt to do, enable,
        or encourage anyone else to do, any of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use branding, logos, icons, user interface
        elements, designs, photographs, videos, or any other materials CanYou
        makes available via the Services, except as explicitly allowed by these
        Terms, the CanYou Brand Guidelines,&nbsp; Brand Guidelines or other
        brand guidelines published by CanYou or our affiliates;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violate or infringe CanYou&rsquo;s or our
        affiliates&rsquo; copyrights, trademarks, or other intellectual property
        rights;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy, modify, archive, download, upload,
        disclose, distribute, sell, lease, syndicate, broadcast, perform,
        display, make available, make derivatives of, or otherwise use the
        Services or the content on the Services, other than temporary files that
        are automatically cached by your web browser for display purposes, as
        otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, as otherwise expressly
        permitted by us in writing, or as enabled by the Service&rsquo;s
        intended functionality;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create more than one account for yourself,
        create another account if we have already disabled your account, attempt
        to access the Services through unauthorised third-party applications,
        solicit login credentials from other users, or buy, sell, rent, or lease
        access to your account, a username, CanYous, or a friend link;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverse engineer, duplicate, decompile,
        disassemble, or decode the Services (including any underlying idea or
        algorithm), or otherwise extract the source code of the software of the
        Service;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use any robot, spider, crawler, scraper, or
        other automated means or interface to access the Services or extract
        other users&rsquo; information;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use or develop any third-party applications that
        interact with the Services or other users&rsquo; content or information
        without our written consent;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the Services in a way that could interfere
        with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully
        enjoying the Services, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or
        impair the functioning of the Services;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upload viruses or other malicious code or
        otherwise compromise, bypass, or circumvent the security of the
        Services;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to circumvent any content-filtering
        techniques we employ, or attempt to access areas or features of the
        Services that you are not authorised to access;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of our
        Services or any system or network;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violate any applicable law or regulation in
        connection with your access to or use of the Services; or
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;access or use the Services in any way not
        expressly permitted by these Terms or our Community Guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>8. Respecting Others' Rights</p>
      <p>
        CanYou respects the rights of others. And so should you. You therefore
        may not use the Services, or enable anyone else to use the Services, in
        a manner that violates or infringes someone else&rsquo;s rights of
        publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property
        right. When you submit content to the Service, you are solely
        responsible for ensuring and must ensure that you own that content, or
        that you have received all necessary permissions, clearances, and
        authorisations in order to submit it to the Service (including, if
        applicable, the right to make mechanical reproductions of the musical
        works embodied in any sound recordings, synchronise any compositions to
        any content, publicly perform any compositions or sound recordings, or
        any other applicable rights for any music not provided by CanYou that
        you include in your content) and grant the rights and licenses contained
        in these Terms for your content. You also agree that you will not use or
        attempt to use another user&rsquo;s account except as permitted by
        CanYou or its affiliates.
      </p>
      <p>
        CanYou honors copyright laws, including the Digital Millennium Copyright
        Act and takes reasonable steps to expeditiously remove from our Services
        any infringing material that we become aware of. If CanYou becomes aware
        that a user has repeatedly infringed copyrights, we will take reasonable
        steps within our power to terminate the user&rsquo;s account. If you
        believe that anything on the Services infringes a copyright that you own
        or control, please report it using the form accessible through this
        tool. Or you may file a notice with our designated agent: CanYou Inc.,
        Attn: Copyright Agent, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, email:
        copyright @ CanYou.com. Don&rsquo;t use this email address for anything
        other than reporting copyright infringement, as such emails will be
        ignored. To report other forms of infringement on the Services, please
        use the tool accessible here. If you file a notice with our Copyright
        Agent, it must:
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain the physical or electronic signature of
        a person authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the copyrighted work claimed to have
        been infringed;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify the material that is claimed to be
        infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be
        removed, or access to which is to be disabled, and information
        reasonably sufficient to let us locate the material;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide your contact information, including your
        address, telephone number, and an email address;
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a personal statement that you have a
        good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained
        of is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide a statement that the information in the
        notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are
        authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner.
      </p>
      <p>9. Safety</p>
      <p>
        We try hard to keep our Services a safe place for all users. But we
        can&rsquo;t guarantee it. That&rsquo;s where you come in. By using the
        Services, you agree that you will at all times comply with these Terms,
        including our Community Guidelines and any other policies CanYou makes
        available in order to maintain the safety of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you fail to comply, we reserve the right to remove any offending
        content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and notify
        third parties&mdash;including law enforcement&mdash;and provide those
        third parties with information relating to your account. This step may
        be necessary to protect the safety of our users, and others, to
        investigate, remedy, and enforce potential Terms violations, and to
        detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also care about your physical safety while using our Services. So do
        not use our Services in a way that would distract you from obeying
        traffic or safety laws. For example, never use the Services while
        driving. And never put yourself or others in harm&rsquo;s way just to
        capture a CanYou.
      </p>
      <p>10. Your Account</p>
      <p>
        To use certain Services, you need to create an account. You agree to
        provide us with accurate, complete, and updated information for your
        account. You are responsible for any activity that occurs in your
        account. So it&rsquo;s important that you keep your account secure. One
        way to do that is to select a strong password that you don&rsquo;t use
        for any other account. If you think that someone has gained access to
        your account, please immediately reach out to Support. Any software that
        we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates,
        or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic
        downloads through your device&rsquo;s settings. You agree not to create
        any account if we have previously removed or banned you or your account
        from any of our Services, unless we consent otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>11. Memories</p>
      <p>
        Memories is our data-storage service that makes it easier for you to
        reminisce anytime, anywhere. By agreeing to these Terms, you
        automatically enable Memories. Once Memories is enabled, it will remain
        enabled for as long as you maintain your CanYou account. But you can
        turn off certain Memories features in Settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the options we provide with Memories is the ability to create a
        restricted area by setting a passcode, which might be a PIN or a
        passphrase or some other mechanism. This is similar to the device-lock
        option you may be using on your mobile device; by setting a passcode,
        you make it less likely that another person who gets a hold of your
        device will be able to see what you saved to the restricted area of
        Memories. But here&rsquo;s a big warning: if you lose or forget your
        Memories passcode, or if you enter the wrong one too many times, you
        will lose access to any content you saved in the restricted area of
        Memories. We don&rsquo;t offer any passcode recovery features for this
        restricted area. You are solely responsible for remembering your
        passcode. Please go to our Support Site for more details on passcodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your content in Memories might become unavailable for any number of
        reasons, including things like an operational glitch or a decision on
        our end to terminate your account. Since we can&rsquo;t promise that
        your content will always be available, we recommend keeping a separate
        copy of content you save to Memories. We make no promise that Memories
        will be able to accommodate your precise storage needs. We reserve the
        right to set storage limits for Memories, and we may change these limits
        from time to time in our sole discretion. And just as with our other
        Services, your use of Memories may take up space on your device and may
        incur mobile data charges.
      </p>
      <p>12. Data Charges and Mobile Phones</p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using
        our Services, including text-messaging (such as SMS, MMS, or future such
        protocols or technologies) and data charges. If you&rsquo;re unsure what
        those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using
        the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        By providing us with your mobile phone number, you agree to receive SMS
        messages from CanYou related to the Services, including about
        promotions, your account, and your relationship with CanYou. These SMS
        messages may be made to your mobile phone number even if your mobile
        phone number is registered on any kind of &ldquo;Do Not Call&rdquo;
        list, or international equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to
        create an account, you must update your account information through
        Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending messages intended
        for you to someone else.
      </p>
      <p>13. Third-Party Services</p>
      <p>
        Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data,
        information, applications, features or materials from third parties
        (&ldquo;Third-Party Materials&rdquo;), or provide links to certain
        third-party websites. If you use any Third-Party Materials made
        available through our Services (including Services we jointly offer with
        the third party), each party&rsquo;s terms will govern the respective
        party&rsquo;s relationship with you. Neither CanYou nor our affiliates
        are responsible or liable for a third party&rsquo;s terms or actions
        taken under the third party&rsquo;s terms. Further, by using the
        Services, you acknowledge and agree that CanYou is not responsible for
        examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness,
        availability, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality,
        decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third-Party Materials or
        websites. We do not warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not
        have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any
        third-party services, Third-Party Materials or third-party websites, or
        for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.
        Third-Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as
        a convenience to you.
      </p>
      <p>14. Modifying the Services and Termination</p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones
        all the time. That means we may add or remove features, products, or
        functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services
        altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we
        do, we will try to notify you beforehand&mdash;but this won&rsquo;t
        always be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we hope you remain a lifelong CanYou User, you can terminate these
        Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your CanYou account
        (or, in some cases, the account associated with the applicable part of
        the Services you are using).
      </p>
      <p>
        We may terminate or temporarily suspend your access to the Services if
        you fail to comply with these Terms, our Community Guidelines or the
        law, for any reason outside of our control, or for any reason, and
        without advanced notice. That means that we may terminate these Terms,
        stop providing you with all or any part of the Services, or impose new
        or additional limits on your ability to use our Services. And while
        we&rsquo;ll try to give you reasonable notice beforehand, we can&rsquo;t
        guarantee that notice will be possible in all circumstances. For
        example, we may deactivate your account due to prolonged inactivity, and
        we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and CanYou continue
        to be bound by Sections 3, 4 (to the extent any additional terms and
        conditions would, by their terms, survive), and 6 - 22 of the Terms.
      </p>
      <p>15. Indemnity</p>
      <p>
        You agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and
        hold harmless CanYou, our affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders,
        employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all
        complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and
        expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) due to, arising out of, or
        relating in any way to: (a) your access to or use of the Services; (b)
        your content, including infringement claims related to your content; (c)
        your breach of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; or (d)
        your negligence or willful misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>16. Disclaimers</p>
      <p>
        We will try hard to keep the Services up and running and free of
        annoyances. But we make no promises that we will succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
        available&rdquo; and to the extent permitted by law and except as stated
        above, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied,
        including, in particular implied warranties, conditions, or other terms
        relating to (i) merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a
        particular purpose, title, quiet enjoyment, non-infringement, or (ii)
        arising from a course of dealing. In addition, while CanYou Group
        Limited attempts to provide a good user experience, we do not represent
        or warrant that: (a) the Services will always be entirely secure,
        error-free or timely; (b) the Services will always function without
        delays, disruption or imperfections; or (c) any content or information
        you obtain through the Services will always be timely or accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSIONS
        PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE, THOSE EXCLUSIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE
        EXTENT PROHIBITED.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, CanYou Group Limited, CanYou
        Inc., and our affiliates take no responsibility and assume no liability
        for any content that you, another user, or a third party creates,
        uploads, posts, sends, receives, views, or stores on or through our
        Services and you understand and agree that you may be exposed to content
        that might be offensive, illegal, misleading, or otherwise
        inappropriate, none of which CanYou Group Limited, CanYou Inc., nor our
        affiliates will be responsible for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms will exclude or limit any responsibility we may
        have to remove content if so required by the law of the country where
        you live.
      </p>
      <p>17. Limitation of Liability</p>
      <p>
        CanYou Group Limited, CanYou Inc., and our affiliates, directors,
        officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, suppliers, and agents will
        not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
        punitive, or multiple damages, or any loss of profits or revenues,
        whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use,
        goodwill or other intangible losses, resulting from: (a) your use of the
        Services or inability to use the Services; (b) your access to or
        inability to access the Services; (c) the conduct or content of other
        users or third parties on or through the Services; or (d) unauthorized
        access, use or alteration of your content. Except to the extent
        specified otherwise in any other applicable terms of CanYou Group
        Limited, CanYou Inc., or our affiliates, in no event will CanYou Group
        Limited, CanYou Inc., or our affiliates&rsquo; aggregate liability for
        all claims relating to the Services exceed the greater of (a) &euro;100
        EUR, and (b) the amount you paid CanYou Group Limited in the last 12
        months for any Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms (or for the avoidance of doubt any other terms to
        which you are subject in respect of the provision of Services by CanYou
        Group Limited, CanYou Inc., or our affiliates) shall exclude or limit
        CanYou Group Limited&rsquo;s, CanYou Inc.&rsquo;s, or our
        affiliates&rsquo; liability for: (a) death or personal injury arising
        from their own respective intent or negligence; (b) fraud or fraudulent
        misrepresentation; or (c) any other liability to the extent that such
        liability may not be excluded or limited as a matter of law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights as a
        consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        IF THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU LIVE DOES NOT ALLOW ANY LIMITATION
        OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS CLAUSE, THAT LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY
        TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED.
      </p>
      <p>18. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</p>
      <p>
        If you have a concern, let&rsquo;s talk. Go ahead and contact us first
        and we&rsquo;ll do our best to resolve the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of our Services may have additional terms that contain
        dispute-resolution provisions unique to that Service or your residency.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using the Services on behalf of a business (rather than for
        your personal use), you and CanYou Group Limited agree that to the
        extent permitted by law, all claims and disputes between us arising out
        of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services will be finally
        settled through binding arbitration under the LCIA Arbitration Rules,
        which are incorporated by reference into this clause. There will be one
        arbitrator (to be appointed by the LCIA), the arbitration will take
        place in London, and the arbitration will be conducted in English. If
        you do not wish to agree to this clause, you must not use the Services.
      </p>
      <p>19. Exclusive Venue</p>
      <p>
        To the extent that these Terms allow you or CanYou to initiate
        litigation in a court, both you and CanYou agree that all claims and
        disputes (whether contractual or otherwise), arising out of or relating
        to the Terms or the use of the Services will be litigated exclusively in
        the courts of England in the United Kingdom, unless this is prohibited
        by the laws of the country where you reside. You and CanYou consent to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.
      </p>
      <p>20. Choice of Law</p>
      <p>
        The laws of England and Wales govern these Terms and any claims and
        disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise) arising out of or
        relating to these Terms or their subject matter. The courts in some
        countries may not apply the laws of England and Wales to some disputes
        related to these Terms. If you reside in one of those countries, the
        laws of your home country may apply to those disputes.
      </p>
      <p>21. Severability</p>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that
        provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity
        and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
      </p>
      <p>22. Final Terms</p>
      <p>
        These Terms, including the additional terms referenced in Section 4,
        make up the entire agreement between you and CanYou, and supersede any
        prior agreements. These Terms do not create or confer any third-party
        beneficiary rights. If we do not enforce a provision in these Terms, it
        will not be considered a waiver. We reserve the right to transfer our
        rights under these Terms and provide the Services using another entity,
        provided that entity upholds these Terms. You may not transfer any of
        your rights or obligations under these Terms without our consent. We
        reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
